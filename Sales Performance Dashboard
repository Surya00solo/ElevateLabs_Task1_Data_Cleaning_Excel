Objective:
To create compelling visualizations that tell a story about sales performance from the given dataset, focusing on key insights and business implications.

Tool Used:
Power BI

Dashboard Overview:
My dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of sales performance, combining key performance indicators (KPIs), trend analysis, and categorical breakdowns to offer actionable insights.

Key Findings & Business Insights:

Solid Performance Foundation: The business demonstrates a strong operational base with 5901 total orders, yielding $1.57M in total sales and a healthy $175.26K in total profit. Efficiency is also evident with an average product quantity of 4 units per order and quick 4-day average delivery times.
Consistent Growth Trajectory (2019 vs. 2020): Both sales and profit exhibited a clear upward trend in 2020 compared to 2019 across most months. This indicates positive business growth and successful strategies implemented in the latter year.
Category & Sub-Category Dominance: My "Sales by Category" and "Top Selling Sub-Category" charts highlight the leading product lines contributing to revenue, allowing for focused inventory management and marketing efforts.
Regional & Operational Insights: The "Sales by Region" and "Sales by Payment Mode" visuals provide valuable insights into market strengths and customer preferences. The geographic map further pinpoints high-performing sales territories within the United States.
Shipping Efficiency: "Sales by Ship Mode" illustrates the preferred shipping methods, potentially informing logistics optimization.
Visual Storytelling Approach:

I aimed for clarity and impact, using:

Line Charts for temporal trends (Sales & Profit Comparison YoY) to easily visualize growth.
Bar Charts for categorical comparisons (Sales by Category, Top Selling Sub-Category) for quick identification of top performers.
Doughnut Charts for proportional breakdowns (Sales by Region, Payment Mode, Segment) to show contributions to the whole.
A Map Visual for geographic sales distribution within the United States, offering intuitive spatial insights.
